## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience with practical examples and exercises.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform allows you to manage infrastructure with configuration files that describe the desired state of your infrastructure. It can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions, and it has a large community and ecosystem.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different aspect or component of Terraform:

- **/examples**: Contains practical examples to help you understand how to use Terraform.
- **/modules**: Reusable components that can be used across different projects.
- **/docs**: Documentation related to the project and Terraform concepts.
- **/scripts**: Helper scripts for setting up and managing your Terraform environment.
